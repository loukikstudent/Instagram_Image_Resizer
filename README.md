# Instagram_Image_Resizer
 In this, there exist a exceutable python program that requires the location of your JPEG folder and will later create and folder called "Instagram" that will be created in the parent directory of your JPEG path. This will only resize your pictures that are vertical (i.e height is more than the widht of the picture) and keep it's detailing but just adds padding to it so that your entire picture fits onto your feed.

# How to use
Step 1) Download the zip of this repository and extract it

Step 2) Extract the zip to the desired location

Step 3) Open the folder called "resize" and run the executable file "resize.exe"

Step 4) Enter the location of your folder that contains your JPEGS

Step 5) Enter "0" for black padding or "255" for white padding based on your choices


Step 6) Press Enter




This should create a folder in the parent directory of your folder of JPEGS called "Instagram" while it adds padding to all your JPEGs and creats new JPEGS of the same name into the "Instagram" folder recently created with the desired choice.
